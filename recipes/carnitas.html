  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This tasty Mexican dish is perfect for meat lovers! Accompany them with your carb of choice, and you're sure to
    have a delicious meal. They can even be cooked on a grill or on a campfire, so they're the perfect match for a bag
    of nachos and a camping trip!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 pounds boneless pork shoulder</li>
    <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt, or 1 teaspoon per pound of meat</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
    <li>1 white onion, sliced</li>
    <li>1 Fresno chili pepper, seeded and halved, or more to taste</li>
    <li>6 garlic cloves, skin on</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the pork into 2-inch pieces. Stack 2 (7x10x3-inch) disposable foil baking pans and transfer in the pork.
      Season with salt, pepper, and oregano, and toss with your hands until everything is evenly coated.</li>
    <li>Cover the pan with a sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and crimp tightly around the edges. Place on top of
      another large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, and then wrap the foil up over the pan. All seams should be
      rolled facing up. Repeat with two more sheets of aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Place the pan next to a campfire, or in a charcoal grill, and arrange the burning coals evenly around the pan.
      Wrap a sheet pan in foil, place over the pan, and arrange some charcoal on top.</li>
    <li>Use a probe or laser thermometer to check the temperature on the surface of the bottom pan. Try to maintain a
      constant temperature of between 250 to 300 Fahrenheit (120 to 150 Celsius). Cook until falling-apart tender (4 to
      5 hours).</li>
  </ol>
